// This file is intentionally left blank or can be removed.
// The POSPage content has been moved to /app/(app)/page.tsx
// and will be rendered by the /app/(app)/layout.tsx.

// If you want a redirect from the root `/` to `/app` or a specific page
// within the (app) group, you can configure that in next.config.js
// or handle it with a middleware.

// For now, to avoid 404 on the root, we can make this a simple redirect
// to the (app) group's default page if needed, or just let it be.
// However, Next.js expects a default export from page.tsx.

// Option 1: Simplest - just export null or a minimal component
// export default function RootPage() {
//  return null; // Or some placeholder/redirect logic
// }

// Option 2: If you want to ensure / always goes to the main POS page
// which is now at /app/(app)/page.tsx (effectively still `/`)
// this file can be deleted if /app/(app)/page.tsx serves as the root.
// Let's assume /app/(app)/page.tsx will handle the root.

// If Next.js requires a page.tsx at the root app level even with route groups,
// and if app/(app)/page.tsx doesn't automatically become the site root,
// we might need a simple component here or a redirect.

// For now, I will remove the old content.
// The new structure with `app/(app)/page.tsx` should handle the root route.
// If there is an issue with the root route, we may need to add a page file here.

export default function HomePage() {
  // This page will likely not be hit if app/(app)/page.tsx serves the root.
  // If it is, you might want to redirect or display a specific landing page.
  return null;
